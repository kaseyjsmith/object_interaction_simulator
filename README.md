# Object Interaction Simulator

I've had an urge to make something tangible. I figured an object collision simulator would be a fun thing to make in Pygame and could be a (potentially endless) iterative optimization problem. 

# Features

- Gravity, air friction, and ground friction on objects
- Object collision
- Reflexive edge detection when window is resized during simulation
- Frame-by-frame mode for analyzing interactions
